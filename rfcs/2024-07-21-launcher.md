RFC: Launcher config

## Summary

Allow Featurevisor SDKs to be set up with a single launcher config URL, which contains configuration necessary for creating the SDK instance.

TODO: come up with a better name than `launcher`.

## Motivation

### Currently

We create SDK instance with several options which are hardcoded in the applications:

```js
import { createInstance } from "@featurevisor/sdk";

const f = createInstance({
  datafileUrl: "https://cdn.yoursite.com/production/datafile-tag-web.json",
  refreshInterval: 60 * 60, // in seconds, 1 hour
});
```

It currently does not have any option for request timeouts and retry logic.

### Challenges

While Featurevisor SDKs allow refreshing datafile content without having to restart the application, options like `refreshInterval` are still hardcoded by application developers.

To make any changes there, we still have to rely on making application code changes and deploy them again. For native apps like iOS and Android, this can be more challenging since we have to wait longer for this kind of change to take impact for all users.

## Detailed design

There are two types of configuration to be fetched by clients here:

- **Datafile**: the generated JSON file which packs all the feature configurations in
- **Launcher config** (new): a new kind of JSON file containing configuration for setting up the SDK in apps

### Example usage

Setting up the SDK using launcher config URL only:

```js
import { createInstance } from "@featurevisor/sdk";

const f = createInstance({
  launcherUrl: "https://cdn.yoursite.com/production/launcher-tag-web.json",
});
```

Contents of the fetched launcher config JSON file:

```js
// GET https://cdn.yoursite.com/production/launcher-tag-web.json

{
  // Datafile fetching specific configs
  datafile: {
    // required
    url: "https://cdn.yoursite.com/production/datafile-tag-web.json",

    // optional
    refreshInterval: 3600, // 1 hour
    timeout: 5, // 5 seconds
    retry: {
      // required
      attempts: 5,
      interval: 5,

      // optional
      backOffRate: 2,
      jitterRange: [0, 5] // 0 and 5 seconds
    }
  },

  // SDK setup specific configs
  launcher: {
    // url (not needed because this is something we expect app developers to hardcode in their apps)

    // optional
    refreshInterval: 3600, // 1 hour
    timeout: 5, // 5 seconds
    retry: {
      // required
      attempts: 5,
      interval: 5,

      // optional
      backOffRate: 2,
      jitterRange: [0, 5] // 0 and 5 seconds
    }
  }
}
```

### Comparing datafile and launcher config

They are pretty much the same:

| Config key          | Datafile | Launcher   | Description                          |
| ------------------- | -------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `url`               | Required | Not needed | URL to fetch the JSON file           |
| `refreshInterval`   | Optional | Optional   | How often to fetch the JSON file     |
| `timeout`           | Optional | Optional   | Request timeout                      |
| `retry`             | Optional | Optional   | Retry logic                          |
| `retry.attempts`    | Optional | Required   | Number of retry attempts             |
| `retry.interval`    | Optional | Required   | Interval between retries             |
| `retry.backOffRate` | Optional | Optional   | Exponential backoff rate for retries |
| `retry.jitterRange` | Optional | Optional   | Random jitter range for retries      |

### Why have launcher config inside the JSON file?

Because we may also want to change the SDK setup configuration without having to redeploy applications.

### Breaking changes

No breaking changes.

Those who wish to continue using existing `datafileUrl` option, nothing changes for them.

### How to manage launcher config files?

We can choose to manage them in the same repository inside a new `launcher` directory:

```
$ tree launcher
.
├── production
│   └── launcher-tag-web.json
└── staging
    └── launcher-tag-web.json
```

### How to generate the launcher config files for uploading to CDN?

Currently, datafiles are generated in `dist` directory with this directory structure:

```
$ tree dist
.
├── production
│   └── datafile-tag-web.json
└── staging
    └── datafile-tag-web.json
```

During the build step, Featurevisor CLI can check if the `launcher` directory exists in the project root and copy the files to `dist` directory:

```
$ tree dist
.
├── production
│   ├── datafile-tag-web.json
│   └── launcher-tag-web.json
└── staging
    ├── datafile-tag-web.json
    └── launcher-tag-web.json
```

Now the entire `dist` directory can be uploaded to CDN in one go conveniently.

## Drawbacks

While launcher configs bring in additional flexibility, it also means applications will make one more request to fetch the launcher config file, before datafile is fetched and SDK becomes ready.

## Alternatives

Launcher config could also be put inside generated datafiles, helping avoid an additional request to fetch the launcher config file by clients.

## Implementation plan

- Add support for linting `launcher` directory in Featurevisor CLI
- Add support for copying launcher config files to `dist` directory during build step
- Add support for `launcherUrl` option in SDKs
- Update documentation
- Update examples
