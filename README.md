# What is Featurevisor?

Featurevisor is a solution for managing your feature flags, experiments, and remote config. It's built for developers, by developers.

Workflow can be broken down into 3 steps:

- 1️⃣ Manage feature flags, experiments, and remote config in your Git repository
- 2️⃣ Trigger CI/CD pipeline to generate and upload datafiles (static JSON files) to your CDN
- 3️⃣ Fetch and evaluate datafiles in your applications using Featurevisor SDKs

More documentation available at [https://featurevisor.com](https://featurevisor.com).

Supported features:

- 🚩 **Feature flags**: classic on/off switches
- 🆎 **Experimentation**: a/b and multivariate tests
- 👥 **Segmentation**: reusable conditions for targeting groups of users
- ↗️ **Gradual rollouts**: avoid big bang releases, and go from 0% to 100% rollout gradually
- 🔧 **Variables**: store key/value pairs for remote config namespaced under each feature
- 🎯 **Consistent bucketing**: makes sure same user gets same variation across devices/sessions
- 🌏 **Multiple environments**: Go beyond just staging and production to fit your needs
- 🏷️ **Tagging**: Load only features relevant to your application, avoiding bloat
- 👁️ **Tracking**: Track experiment activations with your favourite analytics tool

SDK support:

- [JavaScript](https://featurevisor.com/docs/sdks/) (both Node.js and browser environments)
- [React](https://featurevisor.com/docs/react/)
- [Vue.js](https://featurevisor.com/docs/vue/)

Swift and Kotlin SDKs are coming soon for native apps.

# Quick start

You are recommended to see a more detailed quick start guide here: [https://featurevisor.com/docs/quick-start/](https://featurevisor.com/docs/quick-start/).

The whole process can be broken down into 3 steps:

## Step 1: Create a Featurevisor project

Install Featurevisor CLI globally (or use `npx @featurevisor/cli`):

```
$ npm install -g @featurevisor/cli
```

Initialize a new Featurevisor project:

```
$ mkdir my-featurevisor-project && cd my-featurevisor-project
$ featurevisor init
```

You can now create and manage your feature flags, experiments, and remote config in this directory expressed as YAMLs.

See the building block guides here:

- [Attributes](https://featurevisor.com/docs/attributes/): building block for conditions
- [Segments](https://featurevisor.com/docs/segments/): conditions for targeting users
- [Features](https://featurevisor.com/docs/features/): feature flags and variables with rollout rules

## Step 2: Build and deploy datafiles

Once the project is ready, you can build your datafiles (JSON files containing configuration of your feature flags):

```
$ featurevisor build
```

You will find the output in `dist` directory, that you can upload to your CDN.

See further guides here:

- [Building datafiles](https://featurevisor.com/docs/building-datafiles/): how to build datafiles
- [Deploying datafiles](https://featurevisor.com/docs/deployment/): how to deploy datafiles to your CDN

A fully functioning example for deploying with Cloudflare and GitHub Actions (for free) is available [here](https://github.com/fahad19/featurevisor-example-cloudflare).

## Step 3: Consume datafiles with Featurevisor SDKs

You can now consume the datafiles from your CDN in your applications directly using Featurevisor SDKs.

For Node.js and browser environments, install the JavaScript SDK:

```
$ npm install --save @featurevisor/sdk
```

Now you can initialize the SDK with the URL of your datafile, and evaluate your feature flags:

```js
import { createInstance } from "@featurevisor/sdk";

// Initialize the SDK
const f = createInstance({
  datafileUrl: "https://cdn.yoursite.com/datafile.json",
  onReady: () => console.log("Datafile has been fetched and SDK is ready"),
});

// Evaluate a feature flag
const featureKey = "myFeature";
const context = {
  userId: "user-123",
  country: "nl",
};

const isEnabled = f.isEnabled(featureKey, context);
const variation = f.getVariation(featureKey, context);
const variable  = f.getVariable(featureKey, "someVariableKey", context);
```
