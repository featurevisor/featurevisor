# What is Featurevisor?

Featurevisor is a solution for managing your feature flags and remote config. It's built for developers, by developers.

It introduces a workflow that's fully git-based, where configuration is stored as YAMLs and changes are reviewed and merged via pull requests.

The workflow results into a datafile (JSON file) that can be used by your application to fetch the latest feature flags and remote config, evaluated by Featurevisor SDKs.

More documentation available at [https://featurevisor.com](https://featurevisor.com).
