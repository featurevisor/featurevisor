description: Build your Featurevisor project datafiles

Datafiles are JSON files that are created against combinations of tags and environments. They are used to evaluate features in your application via Featurevisor SDKs. {% .lead %}

## Usage

Use Featurevisor CLI to build your datafiles:

```
$ npx featurevisor build
```

## Output

The build output can be found in the `dist` directory.

If your `featurevisor.config.js` file looks like this:

```js
// featurevisor.config.js
module.exports = {
  tags: ["all"],
  environments: ["staging", "production"],
}
```

Then the contents of your `dist` directory will look like this:

```
$ tree dist
.
├── production
│   └── datafile-tag-all.json
└── staging
    └── datafile-tag-all.json

2 directories, 2 files
```

Next to datafiles, the build process will also generate some additional JSON files that we can learn about in [State files](/docs/state-files).

## Revision

By default, Featurevisor will use the `version` as exists in `package.json` of the project as the `revision` value in generated datafiles.

You can optionally customize the `revision` value in datafiles by passing a `--revision` flag when building:

```
$ npx featurevisor build --revision 1.2.3
```

## Printing

You can print the contents of a datafile for a single feature in/or an environment without writing anything to disk by passing these flags:

```
$ npx featurevisor build --feature=foo --environment=production --print --pretty
```

Or if you with to print datafile containing all features for a specific environment:

```
$ npx featurevisor build --environment=production --print --pretty
```

This is useful primarily for debugging and testing purposes.

If you are an SDK developer in other languages besides JavaScript, you may want to use this handy command to get the generated datafile content in JSON format that you can use in your own [test runner](/docs/testing).
