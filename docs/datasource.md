By default, Featurevisor [CLI](/docs/cli) uses the file system for reading and writing data in your project, given it's a Git repository after all. But the [configuration](/docs/configuration) API allows you to switch to any source via adapters. {% .lead %}

## Accessing datasource

It's unlikely that you will make use of the Datasource API yourself directly, unless you are a [plugin](/docs/plugins) developer.

The `datasource` object allows you to read and write data from/to the Featurevisor project, so that you don't have to deal with the file system (or any other custom source of your project data) directly.

You can refer to the full [datasource API](https://github.com/featurevisor/featurevisor/blob/main/packages/core/src/datasource/datasource.ts) for more details.

## Datasource methods

Once you have access to the `datasource` object, you can use the following methods from its instance:

### Revision

See [state files](/docs/state-files) for more details.

```js
const revision = await datasource.readRevision();
await datasource.writeRevision(revision + 1);
```

### Features

See [features](/docs/features) for more details.

```js
const features = await datasource.listFeatures();
const fooFeatureExists = await datasource.featureExists("foo");
const fooFeature = await datasource.readFeature("foo");
await datasource.writeFeature("foo", { ...fooFeature, ...newData });
await datasource.deleteFeature("foo");
```

### Segments

See [segments](/docs/segments) for more details.

```js
const segments = await datasource.listSegments();
const fooSegmentExists = await datasource.segmentExists("foo");
const fooSegment = await datasource.readSegment("foo");
await datasource.writeSegment("foo", { ...fooSegment, ...newData });
await datasource.deleteSegment("foo");
```

### Attributes

See [attributes](/docs/attributes) for more details.

```js
const attributes = await datasource.listAttributes();
const fooAttributeExists = await datasource.attributeExists("foo");
const fooAttribute = await datasource.readAttribute("foo");
await datasource.writeAttribute("foo", { ...fooAttribute, ...newData });
await datasource.deleteAttribute("foo");
```

### Groups

See [groups](/docs/groups) for more details.

```js
const groups = await datasource.listGroups();
const fooGroupExists = await datasource.groupExists("foo");
const fooGroup = await datasource.readGroup("foo");
await datasource.writeGroup("foo", { ...fooGroup, ...newData });
await datasource.deleteGroup("foo");
```

### Tests

See [testing](/docs/testing) for more details.

```js
const tests = await datasource.listTests();
const fooTest = await datasource.readTest("foo");
await datasource.writeTest("foo", { ...fooTest, ...newData });
await datasource.deleteTest("foo");
```

### State

See [state files](/docs/state-files) for more details.

```js
const existingState = await datasource.readState(environment);
datasource.writeState(environment, { ...existingState, ...newState });
```

### History

To get history of changes made to a specific entity:

```js
const fooChanges = await datasource.listHistoryEntries("feature", "foo");
```

The first argument for entity type can be one of:

- `feature`
- `segment`
- `attribute`
- `group`
- `test`

## Adapters

Because a Featurevisor project is a Git repository by default, Featurevisor CLI ships with a default adapter that reads and writes data from/to the file system which is called `FilesystemAdapter`.

You don't have to configure this adapter explicitly anywhere, unless you are writing a custom one.

### Writing a custom adapter

You can write your own custom datasource adapter as follows:

```ts
// adapters/custom-adapter.ts
import { Adapter } from "@featurevisor/core";

export class CustomAdapter extends Adapter {
  // ...implement the methods here
}
```

Refer to the implementation of [`FilesystemAdapter`](https://github.com/featurevisor/featurevisor/blob/main/packages/core/src/datasource/filesystemAdapter.ts) to understand more.

### Using a custom adapter

You can swap out the default file system adapter with your custom adapter via you [configuration](/docs/configuration) file as found in `featurevisor.config.js`:

```js
// featurevisor.config.js

const { CustomAdapter } = require("./adapters/custom-adapter");

module.exports = {
  environments: ["staging", "production"],
  tags: ["web", "mobile"],

  adapter: CustomAdapter,
}
```
