### Commands

Clone the [repository](https://github.com/featurevisor/featurevisor).

Run:

```
$ npm ci
$ npm run bootstrap
```

Make your desired changes to any packages or documentation.

To test everything:

Apply project-wide code styles:

If you need to override code style and linter configurations for individual packages, you can do so by adding or changing specific rules in package-level configuration files. For example:

```js
// packages/sdk/prettier.config.js

const rootConfig = require("../../prettier.config");

/** @type {import('prettier').Config} */
const config = {
  ...rootConfig,
  singleQuote: true,
};

module.exports = config;
```

```js
// packages/sdk/.eslintrc.js

const rootConfig = require("../../.eslintrc.js");

/** @type {import("eslint").Linter.Config} */
  const config = {
  ...rootConfig,
  env: {
    node: true,
  },
  rules: {
    ...rootConfig.rules,
    "@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any": "off",
  },
};

module.exports = config;
```

### Testing

You are advised to test your changes locally before submitting a pull request.

The core team uses the `example-1` project as a playground for testing new features and changes.

```
$ cd examples/example-1

$ npm run lint
$ npm run build
$ npm test
$ npm start
```
