description: Learn how to use Featurevisor SDKs

At the moment, we have an SDK for JavaScript only covering Node.js and browser environments. More languages are planned for the future as Featurevisor nears a stable release. {% .lead %}

SDKs are meant to be used in your own applications, where you want to evaluate features.

## Installation

Install with npm:

```
$ npm install --save @featurevisor/sdk
```

## Initialization

The SDK can be initialized in two different ways depending on your needs.

### Synchronous

If you already have the content of your datafile available:

```js
import { createInstance } from "@featurevisor/sdk";

const datafileURL =
  "https://cdn.yoursite.com/production/datafile-tag-all.json";

const datafileContent = await fetch(datafileURL).then((res) => res.json());

const sdk = createInstance({
  datafile: datafileContent
});
```

### Asynchronous

If you want to delegate the responsibility of fetching the datafile to the SDK:

```js
// your-app/index.js
import { createInstance } from "@featurevisor/sdk";

const datafileURL =
  "https://cdn.yoursite.com/production/datafile-tag-all.json";

const sdk = createInstance({
  datafileUrl: datafileUrl,
  onReady: function () {
    // datafile has been fetched successfully,
    // and you can start using the SDK
  }
});
```

If you need to take further control on how the datafile is fetched, you can pass a custom `handleDatafileFetch` function:

```js
const sdk = createInstance({
  datafileUrl: datafileUrl,
  onReady: function () {
    console.log("sdk is ready");
  },
  handleDatafileFetch: function (url) {
    // you can pass custom headers here, etc
    // or even use XMLHttpRequest instead of fetch,
    // as long as it returns a promise with datafile content
    return fetch(url).then((res) => res.json());
  },
});
```

## Getting variations

Once the SDK is initialized, you can get variations of your features as follows:

```js
const featureKey = "my_feature";

const attributes = {
  userId: "123",
  country: "nl",
};

const variation = sdk.getVariation(featureKey, attributes);
```

## Getting variables

```js
const variableKey = "bgColor";

const bgColorValue = sdk.getVariable(featureKey, variableKey, attributes);
```

## Activation

Activation is useful when you want to track what features and their variations are exposed to your users.

It works the same as `sdk.getVariation()` method, but it will also bubble an event up that you can listen to.

```js
const sdk = createInstance({
  datafile: datafileContent,

  // handler for activations
  onActivation: function (
    featureKey,
    variationValue,
    allAttributes,
    capturedAttributes
  ) {
    // allAttributes (object):
    //   - all the attributes used for evaluating

    // capturedAttributes (object):
    //   - attributes that you want to capture,
    //   - marked as `capture: true` in Attribute YAMLs
  }
});

const variation = sdk.activate(featureKey, attributes)
```

From the `onActivation` handler, you can send the activation event to your analytics service.

## Type specific methods

Next to generic `getVariation()`, `activate`, and `getVariable()` methods, there are also type specific methods for each of them:

### `boolean`

```js
sdk.getVariationBoolean(featureKey, attributes);
sdk.activateBoolean(featureKey, attributes);
sdk.getVariableBoolean(featureKey, variableKey, attributes);
```

### `string`

```js
sdk.getVariationString(featureKey, attributes);
sdk.activateString(featureKey, attributes);
sdk.getVariableString(featureKey, variableKey, attributes);
```

### `integer`

```js
sdk.getVariationInteger(featureKey, attributes);
sdk.activateInteger(featureKey, attributes);
sdk.getVariableInteger(featureKey, variableKey, attributes);
```

### `double`

```js
sdk.getVariationDouble(featureKey, attributes);
sdk.activateDouble(featureKey, attributes);
sdk.getVariableDouble(featureKey, variableKey, attributes);
```

### `array`

```js
sdk.getVariableArray(featureKey, variableKey, attributes);
```

### `object`

```ts
sdk.getVariableObject<T>(featureKey, variableKey, attributes);
```

### `json`

```ts
sdk.getVariableJSON<T>(featureKey, variableKey, attributes);
```

## Logging

By default, Featurevisor SDKs will print out logs to the console for `warn` and `error` levels.

### Levels

You can customize it further:

```ts
import { createInstance, createLogger } from "@featurevisor/sdk";

const sdk = createInstance({
  // ...
  logger: createLogger({
    levels: [
      "error",
      "warn",
      "info",
      "debug"
    ]
  })
});
```

### Handler

You can also pass your own log handler, if you do not wish to print the logs to the console:

```ts
const sdk = createInstance({
  // ...
  logger: createLogger({
    levels: ["error", "warn", "info", "debug"],
    handler: function (level, message, details) {
      // do something with the log
    }
  })
});
```

Further log levels like `info` and `debug` will help you understand how the feature variations and variables are evaluated in the runtime against given attributes.
