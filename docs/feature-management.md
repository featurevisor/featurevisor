In software development, a "**feature**" is a distinct unit of functionality that fulfills a particular requirement or solves a specific problem. Features are the building blocks of any software, be it a simple button in a mobile app or a complex enterprise solution. {% .lead %}

Managing these features effectively is critical for the success of any software project, and that's where feature management comes into play.

It is in the end a practice rather than a tool, and this guide will help you understand what it is all about and how Featurevisor can help you with it.

## What is Feature Management?

Feature Management is the practice of controlling the visibility and behavior of different features within a software application. It involves a set of techniques and tools that allow you to:

- **Toggle features**: Turn features on or off without changing the application code.
- **Rollout control**: Gradually release new features to a subset of users.
- **A/B & multivariate testing**: [Experiment](/docs/use-cases/experiments) with different variations of a feature to see which performs better.
- **Remote configuration**: Change the [behavior](/docs/use-cases/remote-configuration) or appearance of features without deploying new application code.

## Challenges with traditional feature management

Traditionally, feature management has been done by hardcoding conditional statements in the application code directly, which lead to several challenges:

- **Code complexity**: Using conditional statements to control features can make the codebase messy.
- **Deployment risks**: Rolling out features without a controlled environment can lead to unexpected issues.
- **Lack of flexibility**: Once a feature is deployed, it's generally difficult to modify or roll it back.
- **Collaboration gaps**: Development, QA, and product management often lack a unified tool to control and monitor features.

## Enter Featurevisor

Featurevisor is an open-source software specifically designed to tackle the challenges of Feature Management. Here's how:

### GitOps principles

Featurevisor adopts [GitOps](/docs/concepts/gitops) workflow, making it easier to manage, review, and approve feature changes through Pull Requests. This brings in accountability and ensures only vetted changes go live.

### Independent configuration deployment

Featurevisor allows you to deploy configurations independently of the main application. These configurations, known as "[**datafiles**](/docs/building-datafiles)", contain all the settings related to your feature flags, A/B tests, and variables.

### Instant updates

Featurevisor's [SDKs](/docs/sdks) ensure latest configuration is fetched in applications, meaning you can toggle features on or off instantly without waiting for a new deployment.

### Cloud Native and unopinionated

Whether you're using AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, or any other cloud service, Featurevisor's [cloud native architecture](/docs/concepts/cloud-native-architecture) seamlessly integrates with your existing tech stack. It has no preference for Git hosting, CI/CD tools, or CDN, offering you unparalleled flexibility.

## Why Choose Featurevisor?

- **Speed & Efficiency**: Enable Continuous Delivery by decoupling feature rollout from code deployment.
- **Control & Safety**: Use [targeting conditions](/docs/segments) to control who sees what, reducing risks and improving user experience.
- **Transparency & Collaboration**: [GitOps](/docs/concepts/gitops) ensures that every change is tracked, making it easier for cross-functional teams to [collaborate](/docs/use-cases/establishing-ownership).

## Conclusion

Feature Management is crucial in modern software engineering for deploying in a safer, faster, and in a more controlled manner.

Featurevisor takes it a notch higher by incorporating best practices like GitOps and offering instant, flexible configurations. By adopting Featurevisor, you're not just choosing a tool; you're opting for a more efficient and effective approach to managing your software's features.
