## Is Featurevisor free?

It is an Open Source project, released under the MIT license. You can use it for free.

## Why is it free? Where's the catch?

There's none really. The tool's author is a developer, and he wanted to see how far he can stretch the limits of declarative files in a git repository for feature management.

The tool started as an experiment itself, but after several releases and iterations, it is increasingly becoming a stable tool that can be used in production.

## Is there any UI for managing features?

Featurevisor is a tool aimed at developers, and its entire workflow is based on working with a Git repository.

Therefore there is no UI involved when it comes to changing anything. You will be editing files in your repository, and committing them to Git.

Except for the [status site](/docs/site), which is a static site generated from the repository content.

## Should I use Featurevisor?

It depends.

If you are a team or organization that is open to managing all their feature flags, experiments, or any remote configuration via a Git repository based workflow, then yes, Featurevisor can fit in nicely.

But until v1.0 stable has landed, you should be prepared to deal with some bugs and issues.

## Can I switch to another tool or SaaS later?

Given you own everything in your own repository, you can switch to any other tool or third-party SaaS at any time later. There's no lock-in.

You will also be owning the responsibility of migration yourself in that case.

## Can I switch from another SaaS to Featurevisor?

Yes, you can. But Featurevisor does not provide any migration tool to import your features and experiments from another service (yet).
