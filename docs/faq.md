## Is Featurevisor free?

It is an Open Source project, released under the MIT license. You can use it for free.

## Why is it free? Where's the catch?

There's none really. The tool's author is a developer, and he wanted to see how far he can stretch the limits of YAMLs in a git repository for feature management.

You can consider the tool itself to be an experiment.

## Is there any UI for managing features?

Featurevisor is a tool aimed at developers, and its entire workflow is based on working with a git repository.

Therefore there is no UI involved.

## Should I use Featurevisor?

It depends.

If you are a small team of developers, and you are comfortable with working with YAMLs and git workflow, then yes, you can consider using Featurevisor.

But given the stable v1.0.0 has not landed yet, you should be prepared to deal with some bugs and issues.

## Can I switch to another tool or SaaS later?

Given you own everything in your own repository, you can switch to any other tool or third-party SaaS at any time later. There's no lock-in.

You will also be owning the responsibility of migration yourself in that case.

## Can I switch from another SaaS to Featurevisor?

Yes, you can. But Featurevisor does not provide any migration tool to import your features and experiments from another service (yet).
