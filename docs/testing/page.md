Features and segments can grow into complex configuration very fast, and it's important that you have the confidence they are working as expected. {% .lead %}

We can write test specs in the same expressive way as we defined our features and segments to test them in great detail.

## Testing features

Assuming we already have a `foo` feature in `features/foo.yml`:

```yml {% path="features/foo.yml" %}
description: Foo feature
tags:
  - all

bucketBy: userId

variablesSchema:
  someKey:
    type: string
    defaultValue: someValue

variations:
  - value: control
    weight: 50

  - value: treatment
    weight: 50

rules:
  production:
    - key: everyone
      segments: '*'
      percentage: 100
```

We can create a new test spec for it in `tests` directory:

```yml {% path="tests/features/foo.spec.yml" %}
feature: foo # your feature key
assertions:
  # asserting evaluated variation
  # against bucketed value and context
  - description: Testing variation at 40% in NL
    environment: production
    at: 40
    context:
      country: nl
    expectedToBeEnabled: true

    # if testing variations
    expectedVariation: control

  # asserting evaluated variables
  - description: Testing variables at 90% in NL
    environment: production
    at: 90
    context:
      country: nl
    expectedToBeEnabled: true

    # if testing variables
    expectedVariables:
      someKey: someValue
```

The `at` property is the bucketed value (in percentage form ranging from 0 to 100) that assertions will be run against. Read more in [Bucketing](/docs/bucketing).

If your project has no [environments](/docs/environments), you can omit the `environment` property in your assertions.

File names of test specs are not important, but we recommend using the same name as the feature key.

## Testing segments

Similar to features, we can write test specs to test our segments as well.

Assuming we already have a `netherlands` segment:

```yml {% path="segments/netherlands.yml" %}
description: The Netherlands
conditions:
  - attribute: country
    operator: equals
    value: nl
```

We can create a new test spec in `tests` directory:

```yml {% path="tests/segments/netherlands.spec.yml" %}
segment: netherlands # your segment key
assertions:
  - description: Testing segment in NL
    context:
      country: nl
    expectedToMatch: true

  - description: Testing segment in DE
    context:
      country: de
    expectedToMatch: false
```

## Matrix

To make things more convenient when testing against a lof of different combinations of values, you can optionally make use of `matrix` property in your assertions.

For example, in a feature test spec:

```yml {% path="tests/features/foo.spec.yml" %}
feature: foo
assertions:
    # define a matrix
  - matrix:
      at: [40, 60]
      environment: [production]
      country: [nl, de, us]
      plan: [free, premium]

    # make use of the matrix values everywhere
    description: At ${{ at }}%, in ${{ country }} against ${{ plan }}
    environment: ${{ environment }}
    at: ${{ at }}
    context:
      country: ${{ country }}
      plan: ${{ plan }}

    # match expectations as usual
    expectedToBeEnabled: true
```

This will then run the assertion against all combinations of the values in the matrix.

{% callout type="note" title="Note about variables" %}
The example above uses variables in the format `${{ variableName }}`, and there quite a few of them.

Just because a lot of variables are used in above example, it doesn't mean you have to do the same. You can mix static values for some properties and use variables for others as it fits your requirements.
{% /callout %}

You can do the same for segment test specs as well:

```yml {% path="tests/segments/netherlands.spec.yml" %}
segment: netherlands # your segment key
assertions:
  - matrix:
      country: [nl]
      city: [amsterdam, rotterdam]
    description: Testing in ${{ city }}, ${{ country }}
    context:
      country: ${{ country }}
      city: ${{ city }}
    expectedToMatch: true
```

This helps us cover more scenarios by having to write less code in our specs.

## Running tests

Use the Featurevisor CLI to run your tests:

```{% title="Command" %}
$ npx featurevisor test
```

If any of your assertions fail in any test specs, it will terminate with a non-zero exit code.

## CLI options

### `entityType`

If you want to run tests for a specific type of entity, like `feature` or `segment`:

```{% title="Command" %}
$ npx featurevisor test --entityType=feature
$ npx featurevisor test --entityType=segment
```

### `keyPattern`

You can also filter tests by feature or segment keys using regex patterns:

```{% title="Command" %}
$ npx featurevisor test --keyPattern="myKeyHere"
```

### `assertionPattern`

If you are writing assertion descriptions, then you can filter them further using regex patterns:

```{% title="Command" %}
$ npx featurevisor test \
    --keyPattern="myKeyHere" \
    --assertionPattern="text..."
```

### `verbose`

For debugging purposes, you can enable verbose mode to see more details of your assertion evaluations

```{% title="Command" %}
$ npx featurevisor test --verbose
```

### `quiet`

You can disable all log output coming from SDK (including errors and warnings):

```{% title="Command" %}
$ npx featurevisor test --quiet
```

### `showDatafile`

For more advanced debugging, you can print the datafile content used by test runner:

```{% title="Command" %}
$ npx featurevisor test --showDatafile
```

Printing datafile content for each and every tested feature can be very verbose, so we recommend using this option with `--keyPattern` to filter tests.

### `onlyFailures`

If you are interested to see only the test specs that fail:

```{% title="Command" %}
$ npx featurevisor test --onlyFailures
```

## NPM scripts

If you are using npm scripts for testing your Featurevisor project like this:

```js {% path="package.json" %}
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "featurevisor test"
  }
}
```

You can then pass your options in CLI after `--`:

```{% title="Command" %}
$ npm test -- --keyPattern="myKeyHere"
```
